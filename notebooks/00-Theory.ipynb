Though these terms are all similar, some communities assign precise definitions to terms (which may be in conflict with other communities' definitions), and others use them interchangeably.\n",

    "3. Applying code originally developed in one situation to another situation (e.g., new data)\n",

    "* controlling for fraud\n",
    "* controlling for errors and artifacts\n",
    "* enabling generalizability and verification of hypothesis\n",

    "\n",
    "Focusing on reproducibility makes it easier to share data and code within an organization; it makes it easier to build upon and extend what has already been done; it makes it easier to transfer knowledge between individuals and groups; and it makes it possible for you to work more effectively and efficiently. These are benefits that are realizable everywhere: in pure science as well as industry.\n",
