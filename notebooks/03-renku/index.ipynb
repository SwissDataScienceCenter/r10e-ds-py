    "\n",
    "Renku is made up of two parts: the renku command-line interface, and the Renkulab server. The distinction is similar to git vs. GitLab. `git` is a set of command-line tools for using version control on a project. GitLab is a server application for managing multiple projects and giving others access to them.\n",

    "Just as with GitHub and git, projects can be started on the server (e.g., [renkulab.io](https://renkulab.io)), or locally, on your laptop or desktop computer. And it is easy to transition a project from one location to the other.\n",
