For this, we will use data on flights obtained from the [US Dept. of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov) to answer the following questions:\n",

    "- Do flights to Austin, TX generally arrive on time?\n",

    "- How does Austin compare to other airports in punctuality?\n",

    "We will initially start with data for just one month and then add more data to see if this changes anything.\n",

The two **local** versions uses renku installed on your computer; the two **hosted** versions use our public https://renkulab.io server as the execution environment. In each execution environment, the **plain** version implements the code in normal Python files, the **notebook** version implements the code in Jupyter Notebooks. Pick one from the matrix below.\n",
