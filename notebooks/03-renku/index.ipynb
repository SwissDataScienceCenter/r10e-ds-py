    "In the hands-on section, we will perform a data-science task using Renku and see how this changes the way you would work and what benefits it provides. For this, we will use data on flights obtained from the [US Dept. of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov) to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do flights to Austin, TX generally arrive on time?\n",
    "- Are flights to Austin from certain locations more often delayed than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of statistics, the tasks are very simple: just compute some means. But the difficulty lies in deriving the values to average. To do this, we will need to build a pipeline consisting of data preprocesing, analysis and visualization of the output of preprocessing, and finally computing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spoiler!** The exercise will simulate a real-world situation. Certain steps will not work correctly, but we will only realize it later on, meaning that we will need to backtrack and fix errors upstream."
