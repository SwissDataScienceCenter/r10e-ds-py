    "In the hands-on section, we will perform a data-science task using renku and see how this changes the way you would work and what benefits it provides. For this, we will use data on flights obtained from the [US Dept. of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov) to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do flights to Austin, TX generally arrive on time?\n",
    "- Are flights to Austin from certain locations more often delayed than others?\n",
    "- How does Austin compare to other airports in punctuality?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will initially start with data for just one month and then add more data to see if this changes anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out our analysis, we will build a pipeline consisting of data pre-procesing, analysis, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spoiler!** The excercise will simulate a real-world situation. Certain steps will not work correctly, but we will only realize it later on, meaning that we will need to backtrack and fix errors upstream."
