# Description

The expectation of reproducibility in scientific work has been long established, and, increasingly, communities and funding sources are actually demanding it. Within the Python ecosystem, there are a variety of tools available to support reproducible data science, but choosing and using one is not always straightforward. In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at the concept of _reproducibility_, and, we will examine the technologies that provide building blocks and survey the landscape of tools. We spend the majority of the time looking at two solutions in particular, [Renku](https://renkulab.io) and [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com), and work through end-to-end scenarios in both.

# Set Up

To avoid conflicts in dependencies, we recommend creating a dedicated environment for this tutorial. You can do this using any tool you like, for example [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). We provide instructions based on conda here. If you use docker, we also provide a Dockerfile with [instructions for set up and use](README-docker.md). If you prefer to use something else, you will need to ensure that `git`, `git-lfs`, `curl`, and `node` are installed in your environment, but you should be able to pip install the requirements.txt file for the rest.

## Step 1: Create Environment

**Create environment using conda**

0. If you do not yet have conda, you should first [install miniconda for your platform](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
1. Download the [conda environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/r10e-ds-py/master/environment.yml)
2. In the directory where `environment.yml` is located, execute `conda env create`

**Verifying the setup**
1. Activate the environment with `conda activate r10eds`
2. Run `git --version` -- the result should be "git version 2.21.0" (or newer)
3. Run `git lfs --version` -- the result should be "git-lfs/2.7.1" (or newer)
4. Run `renku --version` -- the result should be "0.5.0" (or newer)

**Additional setup on Windows**
On Windows, an additional step is necessary. Renku creates symbolic links, and on Windows it is necessary to have privileges in order to do that. Follow these instructions from from [StackExchange/Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/124679/how-do-i-create-a-link-in-windows-7-home-premium-as-a-regular-user/125981#125981) to give your user these privileges.

## Step 2: Clone the tutorial repository

1. Activate the environment with `conda activate r10eds`
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/r10e-ds-py.git`

# Run the tutorial

Once you have the environment set up and repository cloned, you can use them.

0. cd into the tutorial repository `cd r10e-ds-py`
1. Activate the environment with `conda activate r10eds`
2. Start jupyter lab `jupyter lab` (you can also use plan jupyter)


### Optional Components

If you wish, you can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). It is not a requirement, but it will make it possible to dig deeper into certain areas in the tutorial.
